## Sorting a list

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Sorting a list makes many other computations easier
    -   Binary search
    -   Finding the median
    -   Checking for duplicates
    -   Building a histogram
-   How do we sort a list?
-   You are the TA for a course
    -   Instructor has a pile of evaluated exam papers
    -   Papers in random order of marks
    -   Your task is to arrange the papers in descending order of marks
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Strategy 1
    -   Scan the entire pile and find the paper with the minimum marks
    -   Move this paper to a new pile
    -   Repeat with the remaining papers
        -   Add the paper with the next minimum marks to the second pile each time
    -   Eventually, the new pile is sorted in descending order of marks
